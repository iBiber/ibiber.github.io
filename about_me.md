# Something about me
I studied computer science at the [HAW in Hamburg](https://www.haw-hamburg.de) until 2005.  
Since then I have been working at a software companie that is a supplier of manufacturing IT solutions for the regulated industries.
At that companie I am currently a system architect and working in the product development departement.

## Interests
I am interested in the development of software systems and the different system architectures.
I like to learn about new technologies, experiment with them and like to learn about new ways of thinking.

## Some background about my current business
Currently we are working on the transformation of a monolithic cluster-capable application server with clients based on Java-Swing, 4GL, C++ and C# into a microservices or
[Self Contained Systems (SCS) architecture](http://scs-architecture.org/) with HTTP clients.
